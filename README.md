### A small prototype multiplayer game.

Each player has an inventory full of items
on his side of the screen (Player 1 left, Player 2 right) he wants to empty.
In order to achieve this, a player has to catch the item
which currently is at the bottom of his inventory (marked with yellow color).

Both players sit in the same boat (grey circle).

Player 1 can move the boat with the the keys A and D,
player 2 with the left and right arrow.
Moving the boat costs the player energy
which you can see by looking at the
color of the inventory (green => full energy, red => empty).
Players can get new energy by catching items they donâ€™t need yet.

To catch an item,
a player has to press the catch button (S for Player 1, down arrow for player 2)
last before the boat touches the item on the game field.
